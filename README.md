# RayTracing [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sinaatalay/RayTracing.svg)](https://github.com/sinaatalay/RayTracing/blob/main/LICENSE)
RayTracing is a simple C++ project that only depends on standard libraries and consists of a single source file. It was a project for the **Introduction to Computer Graphics** (CMPE 460) course by [Bogazici University Computer Engineering Department](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) offered in Spring 2021.

After compiling and running, the program will create an image saved in the Bitmap (**BMP**) raster image format, as shown below. The program doesn't take any user inputs. However, the locations of the spheres and the walls can be changed in the code. 8K version of the image can be found [here](https://github.com/sinaatalay/RayTracing/blob/main/figures/example8K.png).
